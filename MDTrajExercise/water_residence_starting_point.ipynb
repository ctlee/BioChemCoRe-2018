Waters in the \"bulk solvent\", far away from the protein, generally just float (\"diffuse\") around, occasionally hydrogen bonding with each other, but never for long (unless it's cold. Then you get ice!). Waters around proteins, however, can hydrogen bond and get trapped for a long time. Sometimes these waters are actually necessary for the protein to function (\"structural waters\"). Frequently, binding sites will contain structural waters, and drug molecules can hydrogen bond to them and become more potent.\n",
